#AngularJS
This repository contains example code from our talk about "AngularJS in the frontend" at Umbraco DK Festival 2014 (#umbdkfest). The single purpose is to show the power of [angularJS](https://angularjs.org/) as simple as possible. 

For comments or questions, you can find me on twitter [@filipbech](https://twitter.com/filipbech)

The code for the Umbraco API is available as a seperate repository. All related questions (and credit) should go to  [@pjengaard](https://twitter.com/pjengaard). Repository is avaiable at [https://github.com/rpjengaard/AngularApiTalk](https://github.com/rpjengaard/AngularApiTalk).

###This repository contains three files.
* filters.html - Filters demo (filtering, ordering and formatting)
* css-ani.html -  SearchAPI demo w. css animations
* js-ani.html - Same as css-ani, but w. js-animations
